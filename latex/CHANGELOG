Major changes:

* Removed option ("dt" or "st") in  \usepackage[options]{ethidsc}. Instead the command \type{ARG} was created which is invoked by \maketitle. ARG is any string and intended to describe the type of report. Example \type{Master Thesis}. This is equivalent to \usepackage[dt]{ethidsc} in older versions. The motivation for this change was to remove the restriction

* Replaced IMRT logo with IDSC logo.

* Translated last page to english. (German translation is still available using the \usepackage[german]{ethidsc}).

* Updated the text "statment regarding plagiarism" (last page) to reflect the official statement as of "Decreed in November 2008 by the Rector, ETH Zurich". This text is now See [http://www.ethz.ch/students/semester/plagiarism_s_en.pdf]
